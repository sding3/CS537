To run:
1) Navigate to the directory that contains your whoosh.c.
2) Run the script "runtests" that can be found in this directory. You may
   copy it to another location if you prefer.
3) Remember that you can pass the "-h" flag to the script to see more 
   testing options.

===========================
!If you are failing a test!
===========================
All of the tests for 2a are in the subdirectories in ta/tests/2a/. In most 
directories you will find 3 files: "in", "out", and "err". Unless otherwise
noted by a README file in the test subdirectory, "in" is given as a 
redirection input file to your program, and the expected stdout is in "out" 
while the expected stderr is in "err".
